int main() {
    float answer;
    answer = 1.0/8.0;
    printf("The value of 1/8 is %f\n", answer);
    return 0;
    
   }

/*The reason why the result is 0.000 is because the variable 'answer' is a float, however,
 the values given are integers. When integers are given to a float, it rounds to the lowest who
 integer, which in this case is 0.000. To output the correct answer, the integers 1 and 8 needs to
 be floats by adding ".0"*/
